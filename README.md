# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **hybrid movie recommender** that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide personalized movie suggestions.

---

## How It Works

- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
  Learns user preferences from past ratings using algorithms like SVD or KNN to recommend movies liked by similar users.

- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  Analyzes movie features such as genres and titles to suggest movies similar to a given movie.

- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  Combines recommendations from both models for improved accuracy and personalization. Users can get recommendations by providing either a user ID or a movie title.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user behavior and movie content
- Flexibility to use either or both recommendation strategies
- Easily extendable and customizable
- Built with Python, leveraging libraries such as Surprise and scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. Prepare your movie metadata and user rating datasets.
2. Train the hybrid recommender with your data.
3. Get recommendations by passing a user ID or movie title.
